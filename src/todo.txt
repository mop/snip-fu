The following files must be ported:

* Create a config-file

* mirrorer.rb
** some regexps :(
* matcher.rb				- done
** Regexps :(
* ext/ragel-parser.c			- done
** This might be a hard one :/. Match any-char and do actual inclusion work in
the actions (which can receive configurable tags) might help.
* command_formatter/command_formatter.rb
** Essentially all regexps :(
* buffer_manipulators/jumper_manipulator.rb: 
** first_match
